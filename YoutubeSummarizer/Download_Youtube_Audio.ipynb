Use `--language` to specify the language\n","Detected language: English\n","[00:00.000 --\u003e 00:04.640]  So you have just created your Streamlit application, but you don't want to keep it to yourself\n","[00:04.640 --\u003e 00:07.640]  because you want to share your awesome creation with the world.\n","[00:07.640 --\u003e 00:11.880]  So in this video, I'm going to show you how you could deploy your Streamlit app to the\n","[00:11.880 --\u003e 00:15.240]  Streamlit Community Cloud, and best of all, it's for free.\n","[00:15.240 --\u003e 00:18.160]  So if this sounds like fun, then this video is for you.\n","[00:18.160 --\u003e 00:22.680]  And without further ado, we're starting right now.\n","[00:22.680 --\u003e 00:26.280]  Let's have a look at some of the contents that we're going to be covering today.\n","[00:26.280 --\u003e 00:31.160]  I'm going to show you a five-step process where you could go from step one, building\n","[00:31.160 --\u003e 00:36.760]  a Streamlit app, step two, setting up a Streamlit Community Cloud account, step three, connect\n","[00:36.760 --\u003e 00:42.160]  your GitHub account to the Community Cloud, step four, create a GitHub repo with your\n","[00:42.160 --\u003e 00:48.240]  app, and step five, deploy your Streamlit app to the Community Cloud in just a few clicks.\n","[00:48.240 --\u003e 00:53.880]  So before showing you how to actually deploy your app, let's take a short moment to consider\n","[00:53.880 --\u003e 00:59.280]  the high-level overview of why do you need to deploy your Streamlit app to the cloud.\n","[00:59.280 --\u003e 01:04.160]  So obviously, the most important reason is that you want to share your creation with\n","[01:04.160 --\u003e 01:10.000]  the entire world to see, to make use of, or perhaps to give you comments, feedbacks, and\n","[01:10.000 --\u003e 01:11.320]  points for improvement.\n","[01:11.320 --\u003e 01:15.820]  And best of all, anyone in the world could have access to your app without installing\n","[01:15.820 --\u003e 01:20.960]  any prerequisite Python libraries, as they are able to access the functionality of the\n","[01:20.960 --\u003e 01:23.120]  app right inside their browser.\n","[01:23.120 --\u003e 01:27.800]  So in a nutshell, you have generally two options for deploying your Streamlit app.\n","[01:27.800 --\u003e 01:32.160]  The first one is to manually set up your virtual private server and then configure everything\n","[01:32.160 --\u003e 01:35.360]  so that it works together and your app is hosted.\n","[01:35.360 --\u003e 01:40.320]  Option number two is to use a cloud platform where essentially you could upload your app\n","[01:40.320 --\u003e 01:45.880]  repo onto the GitHub and then connect it to the cloud platform so that it could be hosted.\n","[01:45.880 --\u003e 01:48.780]  And so in this video, we're going to cover the second approach.\n","[01:48.780 --\u003e 01:53.460]  And the reason being is that it's the simplest approach and it will allow you to get up and\n","[01:53.460 --\u003e 01:54.860]  running in no time.\n","[01:54.860 --\u003e 01:58.960]  And of course, the first option where you could create your own private server provides\n","[01:58.960 --\u003e 02:03.780]  you with full control, but then the time and cost involved in setting up the platform would\n","[02:03.780 --\u003e 02:07.140]  require a hefty investment of time and cost.\n","[02:07.140 --\u003e 02:12.460]  So here are some of the reasons why you want to deploy your Streamlit app to the Streamlit\n","[02:12.460 --\u003e 02:13.460]  Community Cloud.\n","[02:13.460 --\u003e 02:15.660]  So the first advantage is that it's free.\n","[02:15.660 --\u003e 02:18.700]  You could deploy your Streamlit apps at no charge.\n","[02:18.700 --\u003e 02:22.820]  Advantage number two, you could deploy it in a few clicks and your fully hosted app\n","[02:22.820 --\u003e 02:25.220]  will be shareable in a few minutes.\n","[02:25.220 --\u003e 02:29.620]  Third advantage is that all of your code is on the cloud in the GitHub repo and this allows\n","[02:29.620 --\u003e 02:31.980]  you to collaborate with your peers.\n","[02:31.980 --\u003e 02:36.060]  Fourth advantage is that it supports live updates to your code so that whenever you\n","[02:36.060 --\u003e 02:40.940]  push a new code change, your Streamlit app will be updated in real time.\n","[02:40.940 --\u003e 02:44.620]  Advantage number five is that you'll be able to securely connect to your data where you\n","[02:44.620 --\u003e 02:48.860]  could connect to all of your data sources using secure protocols.\n","[02:48.860 --\u003e 02:54.140]  Advantage number six, you could restrict access to apps, though by default you'll have access\n","[02:54.140 --\u003e 02:59.220]  to one private app that will allow you to create an app that is not yet ready for the\n","[02:59.220 --\u003e 03:02.340]  public and when it's ready, you could make it public.\n","[03:02.340 --\u003e 03:07.500]  Advantage number seven, you could easily manage all of your Streamlit apps in one control\n","[03:07.500 --\u003e 03:12.420]  center, which will allow you to collaborate with your peers, name or rename your Streamlit\n","[03:12.420 --\u003e 03:16.660]  apps and just generally have a glance in one view all of the apps that you have just\n","[03:16.660 --\u003e 03:17.660]  created.\n","[03:17.660 --\u003e 03:23.660]  All right, and so the first step is to create your Streamlit app and so I'm going to launch\n","[03:23.660 --\u003e 03:31.780]  the Atom IDE on my computer or you could use any other code editor as well.\n","[03:31.780 --\u003e 03:33.580]  So let's create a simple app.\n","[03:33.580 --\u003e 03:43.420]  We're going to import Streamlit as st, then we're going to say st.write and then I'm going\n","[03:43.420 --\u003e 03:53.660]  to say hello world and then we're going to save it.\n","[03:53.660 --\u003e 03:55.060]  We're going to save it to the desktop.\n","[03:55.060 --\u003e 03:59.260]  I'll call it Streamlit app.py.\n","[03:59.500 --\u003e 04:09.020]  So the next step is I'll set up an account on this Streamlit community cloud.\n","[04:09.020 --\u003e 04:20.140]  You could go to streamlit.io slash cloud and then you can see here that all of the high\n","[04:20.140 --\u003e 04:26.660]  level overview is provided here on this web page and you could go ahead and click on sign\n","[04:26.740 --\u003e 04:32.420]  up.\n","[04:32.420 --\u003e 04:39.020]  So you could sign up by continuing by using your Google credentials or your GitHub credentials\n","[04:39.020 --\u003e 04:44.100]  as well or you could also sign up using the traditional approach of putting in your email.\n","[04:44.100 --\u003e 04:51.580]  So let me use my GitHub account.\n","[04:51.700 --\u003e 05:01.500]  So here you put in your GitHub username and then your password and so when you're logging\n","[05:01.500 --\u003e 05:05.260]  in for the first time it's going to ask you for permission.\n","[05:05.260 --\u003e 05:09.740]  So you could authorize Streamlit to have access to your GitHub repo.\n","[05:09.740 --\u003e 05:15.940]  So click on authorize Streamlit and wait just a moment so that you'll be able to deploy\n","[05:15.940 --\u003e 05:21.860]  your app directly from GitHub and click again authorize Streamlit.\n","[05:21.860 --\u003e 05:27.380]  Alright and so you're logged in to the community cloud and because you haven't yet deployed\n","[05:27.380 --\u003e 05:30.980]  your app you're going to see an empty yellow box here.\n","[05:30.980 --\u003e 05:34.980]  So you could go ahead and deploy your first app by clicking new app if you already have\n","[05:34.980 --\u003e 05:40.300]  a GitHub repo but we haven't yet built one so I'm going to show you in just a moment.\n","[05:40.300 --\u003e 05:48.780]  So why don't you go ahead and click on settings and then go to here in the source

you are able to create one private app and you're also able to create\n","[06:00.380 --\u003e 06:06.140]  an unlimited number of public apps and these are some of the support information just in\n","[06:06.140 --\u003e 06:11.060]  case you have any questions or need help you could check out the documentations and also\n","[06:11.060 --\u003e 06:16.540]  the forums and this board so you can see that because we're logging in using our GitHub\n","[06:16.540 --\u003e 06:21.220]  account the Streamlit community cloud already have access to your GitHub repos and so you\n","[06:21.220 --\u003e

to the Streamlit community cloud\n","[06:44.980 --\u003e 06:50.220]  the next step here step number four is to create a GitHub repo for your Streamlit app\n","[06:50.220 --\u003e 06:58.180]  so let's go ahead and go to GitHub and I have already created a repo app here but I'm going\n","[06:58.580 --\u003e 07:08.540]  a new one to show you go ahead and click on new and let me see I'll say hello app and\n","[07:08.540 --\u003e 07:15.860]  I'll make it public and I'll tick on adding a readme file and then you could click on\n","[07:15.860 --\u003e 07:27.100]  the create repository alright and now you could just click on add file create new file\n","[07:27.100 --\u003e 07:37.860]  and then you want to type in Streamlit app.py and then for the contents here you could copy\n","[07:37.860 --\u003e 07:45.100]  and then paste it here or you could also upload the file to your GitHub repo as well and uploading\n","[07:45.100 --\u003e 07:52.300]  is as simple as clicking here in the add file and clicking upload files and then you could\n","[07:52.300 --\u003e 07:59.620]  just drag and drop the file or you could select it from here and then select the file\n","[07:59.620 --\u003e 08:06.460]  and then open because I have already created the file then I'll just skip this part because\n","[08:06.460 --\u003e 08:13.620]  we already have this Streamlit app.py file and let's do a double check click on the file\n","[08:13.620 --\u003e 08:18.140]  and then here we have a very simple app that will write out the hello world statement on\n","[08:18.140 --\u003e 08:26.060]  your app alright so let's deploy the app here and so this is step number five we're going to\n","[08:26.060 --\u003e 08:30.740]  deploy your Streamlit app to the Streamlit community cloud so go ahead and click on new\n","[08:30.740 --\u003e 08:39.620]  app and then in the repository drop-down menu here you want to click on it and then click on\n","[08:40.380 --\u003e 08:52.020]  the repo that we have just created and then the branch here is main because it is main here as\n","[08:52.020 --\u003e 09:05.740]  well and then the name of the file is Streamlit app.py and go ahead and click on deploy and so\n","[09:05.740 --\u003e 09:11.500]  allow a few moments for the app to be deployed on the server and you'll notice here that this\n","[09:11.500 --\u003e 09:17.340]  is the URL that the server has created for you and if you would like to have a shorter version\n","[09:17.340 --\u003e 09:24.540]  of the app name you could go and rename the app so I'll show you in just a moment let's wait for\n","[09:24.540 --\u003e 09:28.980]  the app to be deployed first in the meantime you could click on the manage app and you'll be able\n","[09:29.060 --\u003e 09:37.900]  to see the log so just in case if there's any error you will be able to see in here you can see\n","[09:37.900 --\u003e 09:43.820]  here that it has already done all of the installation of the prerequisite libraries in order

Streamlit\n","[10:00.340 --\u003e 10:05.900]  community cloud and you can see the statement hello world all right and so as promised I'm\n","[10:05.900 --\u003e 10:11.460]  going to show you how you could rename your Streamlit app so go ahead and go back to your\n","[10:11.460 --\u003e 10:19.580]  control center of the community cloud you could just type in share.streamlit.io all right and so\n","[10:19.580 --\u003e 10:25.300]  this is the app that you have just deployed hello app and if you click on it you're going\n","[10:25.300 --\u003e 10:32.700]  to go to the app that was just launched a few moments ago and so in this button here you want\n","[10:32.700 --\u003e 10:39.020]  to click on it go and click on settings and here you could rename it you could rename it to
