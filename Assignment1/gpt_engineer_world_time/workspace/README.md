Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `CountryTimeApp`: This is the main class for the application. It will handle the GUI and the interaction with the user.
2. `get_country_timezones`: This function will return a list of timezones for a given country.
3. `get_current_time`: This function will return the current time for a given timezone.

We will have two files:

1. `country_time_app.py`: This is the main file that contains the `CountryTimeApp` class and the main function to start the application.
2. `time_utils.py`: This file contains the utility functions `get_country_timezones` and `get_current_time`.

Now, let's write the code for these files.

`requirements.txt`
