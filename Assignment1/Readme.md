Assignment 2: Using GPT Engineer

I have used GPT Engineer, provided prompts and created two python applications. The code and prompts are available in the following folders:

gpt_engineer_bmi_calculator

gpt_engineer_world_time

Steps:

Install all requirements like OpenAI, langchain, dotenv, etc.
Create a virtual environment
Git clone gpt-engineer
In the prompt file, clearly provide the requiremetns based on which application has to be built. 
Generate code based on the prompt using the command: python -m  gpt_engineer.main projects/example
Answer any further questions to provide clarity for gpt-engineer to generate code

Assignment 3: Using Cursor

I have used Cursor, to provide prompts and create two web applications using HTML. The code generated for the applications are available in the 'Cursor Code' folder in this repository. 

Steps:
Download and install Cursor
Use cmd+k to provide prompts
As it generates code, we can provide feedback in the chat window, and improvise code based on our requirement.
