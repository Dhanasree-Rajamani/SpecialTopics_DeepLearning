We will be using Python's tkinter library to create the GUI for this application. The application will consist of two main files:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main GUI logic and event handlers.
2. `bmi_calculator.py`: This file will contain the logic for calculating the BMI.

We will also need a `requirements.txt` file to list the dependencies of the application.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:

main.py
```python
import tkinter as tk
from bmi_calculator import calculate_bmi

def calculate():
    weight = float(weight_entry.get())
    height = float(height_entry.get())
    bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
    result_label.config(text=f"Your BMI is {bmi}")

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("BMI Calculator")

weight_label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter your weight (in kg):")
weight_label.pack()
weight_entry = tk.Entry(root)
weight_entry.pack()

height_label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter your height (in cm):")
height_label.pack()
height_entry = tk.Entry(root)
height_entry.pack()

calculate_button = tk.Button(root, text="Calculate", command=calculate)
calculate_button.pack()

result_label = tk.Label(root, text="")
result_label.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

Next, the `bmi_calculator.py` file:

bmi_calculator.py
```python
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    height_in_meters = height / 100
    bmi = weight / (height_in_meters ** 2)
    return round(bmi, 2)
```

Finally, the `requirements.txt` file:

requirements.txt
```
tkinter==8.6
```

To run the application, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run `python main.py`.
