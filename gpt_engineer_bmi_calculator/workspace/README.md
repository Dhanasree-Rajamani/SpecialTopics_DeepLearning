We will be using Python's tkinter library to create the GUI for this application. The application will consist of two main files:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main GUI logic and event handlers.
2. `bmi_calculator.py`: This file will contain the logic for calculating the BMI.

We will also need a `requirements.txt` file to list the dependencies of the application.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:
