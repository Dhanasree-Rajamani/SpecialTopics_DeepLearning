Question 1:
a) Use chatgpt to write an medium.com article on best practices for writing prompts.
I have written 2 Medium articles - the article has been written based on the knowledge level of reader(basic and advanced).

Article 1: https://medium.com/@dhanasree.rajamani/mastering-the-art-of-prompt-engineering-crafting-thoughtful-questions-for-ai-and-beyond-c55371fe12a2

Article 2: https://medium.com/@dhanasree.rajamani/the-science-behind-prompt-engineering-a-guide-for-ai-nlp-experts-d0b5ef14da6a

Apply this best practices in your custom domain for a full example:

I have applied the best practices in my custom domain, my prompts and GPT's responses are here:
https://chat.openai.com/share/0fda7643-3e82-46f3-a587-ec3c960d5c3f

An app which will critique a given prompt for all the missing information. Here gpt4 acts as expert prompt engineer and it will critique and provide clues on how to improve and suggest changes for improvements so user can accept

b) Here is a gradio application for perfect prompt generation, following all best practices, using gpt4 assisted help. The app will ask very detailed inquiry of the user requirements in iterative back and forth fashion until it has all the information needed.

The application interacts with the user, to understand the requirements better to build an effective prompt.

c) Web app for prompt library with prompt search (use pinecone langchain library) - people can contribute the prompts and search for prompts

This application uses Pinecone langchain, html, python and flask.
