a) For this question, I have built an end2end generative AI based app using Vue, Vite, Vercel and Replit

I have used a template based on Vue and modified it for my usecase.

I have deployed the application using Vercel. 

I have created a generative AI application using Open AI GPT. This application used GPT to answer the questions that the users have. The user first has to input their open AI api key. Then the users can ask any questions they have, and the response is given by Open AI GPT, which is rendered on the application screen.

b) Semantic kernel

For this question, I built a chat copilot with semantic kernel framework end2end using assistant api

I have built a chat copilot, that would help users with their cooking. If a user provides the ingredients they have, and the cuisine and any other special instructions, the application would provide 1 or more recipes based on the user's preferences and ingredients. It also helps further with their cooking answering any questions that the user might have.

I have customized Chat Copilot choosing a planner and changing the System Prompt:
I have designed the system prompt to create an interactive recipe generation based on users preferences and instructions where the AI collaborates with users to generate the recipe that they would love to cook. It generates based on user instructions, customizes and provides multiple detailed steps based on user expectation, while ensuring that it follows the constraints of the AI's knowledge and capabilities.

Here is what the application looks like:
