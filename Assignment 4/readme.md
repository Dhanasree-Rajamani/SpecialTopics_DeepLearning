Advanced Prompt Engineering Strategies

a) This colab illustrates the various prompt engineering techniques. I have demonstrated success and failure cases. Used gpt 3.5 and gpt 4.

Various prompting techniques such as : 

ICL,
CoT,
iCOT,
TOT,
GOT,
AOT,
RASCEF,
REACT
are illustrated in this colab.

b) This colab demonstrates 21 different prompt templates based on slides with practical examples (along with success and failure cases). This also demonstrates examples in the following prompt patterns:

c) In this colab, I have picked 10 diverse fields such as HR, Law, Teaching, Data Science, Robotics, Agriculture and Farming, Healthcare, Information Technology, Environmental Science, Architecture and Tourism. I have written 3 diverse prompts which are very useful in this fields with test cases. (Followed Best practices)

d) In this colab I have used Palm2APi to implement the example applications of open AI. Used best practices of prompt engineering. Some example application implemented are: Grammar correction, explain code, summarize for a 2nd grader, emoji translation, calculate time complexity, parse unstructured data, Marv the sarcastic robot, tweet classifier, Turn by turn directions, emoji chatbot, translation and many more such applications.

e) For this task, I've developed a function that integrates OpenAI's features within the Google Colab online platform. 

It's similar to embedding a button within an online document. 

When activated, this button communicates with OpenAI to retrieve a response, and I am demonstarting its functionality with a real-world example.

f) In this colab, I have written System prompt example usecase of openAI. System prompts can be used to improve the performance of OpenAI models in a variety of ways. For example, system prompts can be used to:

Reduce the amount of training data required to fine-tune a model for a specific task

Improve the accuracy and fluency of translations

Generate more creative and engaging text content

Make the model more responsive to user instructions

When using OpenAI models to perform specific tasks, using system prompts to fine-tune the models for those tasks can help to get the most out of OpenAI models and improve the performance of applications.
